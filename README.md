# Data-Mining-Final

SUMMARY

The initial motivation of this project is to shed light into the long-debated topic of determining indicators that project future development by assessing the effects of currently determine indicators by the World Bank. By the end of this data mining project institutions that collect data on countries and macroeconomic factors like the IMF, IFC, World Bank, UN, OECD, FED, and central banks of individual countries would be highly interested since this project will try to generate an algorithm that classifies countries and provide common ground for comparing countries using various features that determine a country's disposition. This discovery of indicator effects and pattern analysis is considered data mining as I will use various model fittings to find the best algorithm for my conclusion. The data I used can be obtained from, the World Bank Development Indicators data (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712) and 36 OECD countries data to get the member country names (stats.oecd.org and https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-welcomes-costa-rica-as-its-38th-member.htm#:~:text=The%20OECD's%2038%20members%20are,Norway%2C%20Poland%2C%20Portugal%2C%20Slovak) and classification data of development level was from the United Nations country classification file( UNITED NATIONS DEPARTMENT FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS. World economic situation and prospects 2020. UN, 2020.) In conclusion I got 19 most significant indicators along with other indicators that were also significant and can be considered if preferred while I found out that the effect of year is insignificant, contrary to my expectation.
